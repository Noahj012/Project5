#Project 5 Documentation

This project is a culmination of the first 3 project done in CS 2334. It builds off the 
previously etstablished calculations of hamming distance and node distance, and then 
creating a GUI application tot reflect these calculations. I will now describe my problem
solving process.

My first problem was deciding how many classes to make to roganize my code in a meaningful
fashion. Ultimately deciding to create 2 classes in total, one being the 
CalculateHammingDistance class, which takes all the proccesses required in reading the 
mesonet.txt file, sorting the ids in natural ordering ,calculating the node and hamming
distance for the selected station Id. My second classed, GraphHamming was soley comprised 
of managment of the GUI interface. By seperating the functionality of this project has 
allowed my code to be more organized, readable, and consistent.
